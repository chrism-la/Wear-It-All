Project Title
One paragraph of project description goes here

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See Deployment for a link to where the app is currently running.

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Give examples
Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

Give the example
And repeat

until finished
How to Use This App
Running the tests (if there are any)
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (if there are any)

End-to-end tests (if there are any)
Explain what these tests test and why (if there are any)

Give an example 
Coding style tests (if there are any)
Explain what these tests test and why (if there are any)

Give an example
Deployment
This project is currently deployed at _________________________.

Add any additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

Built With
List the languages, libraries, frameworks, and third-party services (such as deployment services) used to build the app.

Authors
List the people on your team

License
You don’t have to add a license to your Milestone 2 Project, but you can. It is a common part of a repo that specifies how the project can be used. Kinds of licenses allowing public use are very similar but have small differences that might matter for a specific project. The MIT or GNU general license are usually fine for a public repo.

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details

Acknowledgments
Citing someone else's code or resources used in the project

Post-MVP Plans
Also called stretch goals
One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
Another that will be a stretch.
Something else I don't technically know how to do... yet. :)
After you finish making/deploying your app, make sure to update and finalize the README.md file for the project, which should be in the top level of your files in the repo so that it's viewable right away when a user sees the "home page" of the repo. Of course, Github and your pinned projects are one of the most important ways for you to show potential employers your skill and professionalism. Make sure there are no glaring spelling errors (this is a great extension to spell check in VSCode: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).

## WHEN YOU'RE READY TO SUBMIT THE PROJECT, MAKE SURE TO REMOVE ALL TEXT IN ITALICS ABOVE AND ALL TEXT BELOW THIS POINT. NOTE: THE README IS NOT JUST A PLACE TO TELL OTHERS ABOUT THE CODE IN YOUR APP, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE A PART OF THE WAY YOU PLAN AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR PROGRESS BUILDING THE APP. ##

API Endpoints
It’s common for developers to show the various endpoints in their frontend and/or backend API/s as you would find in a third-party API provider.

This resource shows examples of different ways you can show your endpoints: https://github.com/bufferapp/README/blob/master/billing/api-endpoints.md.

Schema Diagram
You should likely be using a tool (an app, pen and paper, etc.) to make an ERD (Entity Relational Diagram) if you’re using a relational database or a schema diagram if you’re using a document (NoSQL) database. You can usually use the same tool for diagramming for either kind, but here are some top choices:

ERD: Usually the RDMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) platform being used (PgAdmin, etc.) provides a feature to allow making diagrams from tables you’ve already made in the app.
